# Introduction

The report documentation contains all efforts that were conducted in order to perform a penetration test against X.
This report will be graded from a standpoint of correctness and fullness to all aspects of the exam.

# Objective

The objective of this assessment is to perform a white-box penetration test towards X network.

The operator is tasked with following methodical approach in obtaining access to the objective goals.
This test should simulate an actual white-box penetration test and how you would start from beginning to end, including the overall report.

# Requirements

The operator will be required to fill out this exam documentation fully and to include the following sections:

- Methodology walkthrough and detailed outline of steps taken
- Each finding with included screenshots, walkthrough, sample code, and proof.txt if applicable
- Any additional items that were not included

# High-Level Summary

I was tasked with performing an internal penetration test towards the X system. 
An internal penetration test is a dedicated attack against internally connected systems. 

The focus of this test is to perform attacks, similar to those of an intruder and attempt 
to infiltrate X systems - the ones hosted on the following domains:

- x.net
- xx.net
- xxx.net
- xxxx.net

The overall objective was to evaluate the network, identify systems, and exploit flaws while reporting
the findings back to X GmbH.

The attacks were conducted with the level of access that a general Internet user would have.
The company's assets and access to the source code have been provided by the system owners.
The assessment was conducted in accordance with the recommendations outlined in NIST SP 800-115 
with all tests and actions being conducted under controlled conditions.


When performing the internal penetration test, there were several vulnerabilities that were identified
in X applications and their infrastructure.
