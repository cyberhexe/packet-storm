Social engineering, in the context of information security, is the psychological manipulation of people into performing actions or divulging confidential information. This differs from social engineering within the social sciences, which does not concern the divulging of confidential information. A type of confidence trick for the purpose of information gathering, fraud, or system access, it differs from a traditional "con" in that it is often one of many steps in a more complex fraud scheme. 
It has also been defined as "any act that influences a person to take an action that may or may not be in their best interests." 


As most client side attacks require some form of interaction with the target (requiring the target to click on a link, open an email, run an attachment, open a document, etc), supporting this operation with social engineering efforts can greatly increase your chances of success.


Imagine the following scenario.

```text
You are on an engagement, trying to execute a client side attack against the Human Resources department.
You see an open job posting and send in a fake resume in a malformed PDF that fails to open.
The next day, you get a mail back regarding the human resources manager’s inability to open your resume.
You respond back, asking what version of Acrobat they use, as you might have sent them an incompatible version.
On the way, you sneak in the question:


'..and what Windows version are you running?'


The answer you receive confirms that your target is using a vulnerable version of Acrobat Reader.
Armed with this information, you craft a second PDF file that targets their specific Acrobat and Windows versions, and send it over.
```


Of course, this is a simplified success story – your social engineering pretexts may have to be more intricate.



One more thing a good PI knows: Never end the conversation after getting the key information.
Another two or three questions, a little chat, and then it's okay to say good-bye.
Later, if the victim remembers anything about what you asked, it will probably be the last couple of questions.
The rest will usually be forgotten.


Code of Ethics:
*Leave Them Feeling Better For Having Met You*:

- Respect the public by accepting responsibility and ownership over your actions, and their effects on the welfare of those in, around, and involved with the engagement.
- Before undertaking any social engineering engagement, ensure you are fully aware of the scope and effects on others and their well-being.
- Avoid engaging in, or being a party to, unethical, unlawful, or illegal acts that negatively affect your professional reputation, the information security discipline, the practice of social engineering, others’ well-being, or the parties and individuals in, around, and involved with the engagement.
- Reject any engagement, or aspect of an engagement, that may make a target feel vulnerable or discriminated against. This includes, but is not limited to, sexual harassment, offensive comments (verbal, written, or otherwise) related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, or disability; stalking or following, deliberate intimidation, or harassing materials. Additionally, lewd or offensive behavior or language, which may be sexually explicit or offensive in nature, materials or conduct, language, behavior, or content that contains profanity, obscene gestures, or gendered, religious, ethnic, or racial, slurs are all to be avoided. Employing any of these tactics reduces the target’s ability to learn and improve from the engagement.
- Do not negatively manipulate, threaten, or make others uncomfortable in any way, unless specified by a client due to unique needs and testing environment.
- Minimize risks to the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of information of your employer, clients, and individuals involved in engagements. After performing a social engineering engagement, ensure the security of obtained information is a priority. Never disclose information to outside parties as private and confidential information must remain private and confidential. Do not misuse any information or privileges you are afforded as part of your responsibilities.
- When training future social engineers, consider that training will leave a lasting impact on your students and the methodology with which you train will echo through all students’ future engagements. Provide students with the knowledge and tools to create positive learning environments and productive scenarios for their future engagements and clients.
- Ensure the social engineering practices of yourself and your students include conscientious, thoughtful, and considerate ways to escalate engagements to eventually emulate real-world attack vectors. Recognize our clients are seeking ways to improve their security posture and work with them to increase the difficulty of realistic attack vectors.
- Respect that social engineering engagements involve human vulnerability and avoid publicizing vulnerabilities, whether through a blog, social media, or other medium, that result in harmful effects, emotions, or feelings for your client and the individuals and parties in, around, and involved with the engagement.
- Do not misrepresent your abilities or your work to the community, your employer, or your peers. Ensure you have the experience and knowledge promised to your clients and stakeholders.
