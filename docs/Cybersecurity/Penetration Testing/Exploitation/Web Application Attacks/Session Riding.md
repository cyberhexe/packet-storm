## Session Riding

While we could have successfully hijacked the session, we will only be able to impersonate the target user as long as the session is alive.

In other words, should the user log out, the session cookie will be invalidated and prevent us from assessing the web interface and finishing whatever attack we planned.

There's another interesting (and easier) option we could explore. Rather than stealing the cookie, we could leverage the XSS vulnerability to force our authenticated victim to execute whatever action we want.
In this way, we would ride the victim session turning our XSS into a cross-site request forgery attack (CSRF).
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is an attack that forces an end user to execute unwanted actions on a web application in which theyâ€™re currently authenticated.

CSRF attacks are also known as session riding.

Despite the similar name, it's important to understand the difference between session riding and session hijacking.
In the latter, the attacker uses the stolen cookie to perform the attack, while in the former, the victim is performing the attack on the attacker's behalf through a legitimately authenticated browser session.
