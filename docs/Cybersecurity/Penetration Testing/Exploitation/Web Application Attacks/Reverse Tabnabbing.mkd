Reverse tabnabbing is an attack where a page linked from the target page is able to rewrite that page, for example to replace it with a phishing site. 

As the user was originally on the correct page they are less likely to notice that it has been changed to a phishing site, especially if the site looks the same as the target. 

If the user authenticates to this new page then their credentials (or other sensitive data) are sent to 
the phishing site rather than the legitimate one.

## Examples:

Vulnerable page:
```html
<html>
  <body>
    <li><a href="bad.example.com" target="_blank">Vulnerable target using html link to open the new page</a></li>
   <button onclick="window.open('https://bad.example.com')">Vulnerable target using javascript to open the new page
   </button>
  </body>
</html>
```

Malicious Site that is linked to:
```html
<html>
  <body>
    <script>
       if (window.opener) {
          window.opener.location = "https://phish.example.com";
       }  
    </script>
   </body>
</html>
```
