## Blind SQL Injection

In a blind SQLi attack, no data is actually transferred via the web application as the result of the injected payload. The attacker is therefore not able to see the result of an attack in-band.

This leaves the attackes with only one choice: inject queries that ask a series of YES and NO questions (boolean queries) to the database and construct the sought information based on the answers to those questions.
The way the information can be inferred depends on the type of blind injection we are dealing with.

Blind SQL injections can be classified as boolean-based or time-based.

In Boolean-based injections an attacker injects a boolean SQL query into the database, which forces the web application to display different content in the rendered web page depending on whether the query evaluates to TRUE or FALSE.
In this case the attacker can infer the outcome of the boolean SQL payload by observing the differences in the HTTP response content.

In time-based blind SQL injections our ability to infer any information is even more limited because a vulnerable application does not display any differences in the content based on our injected TRUE/FALSE queries. In such cases, the only way to infer any information is by introducing artificial query delays in the injected subqueries via database-native functions that consume time.
In that case of MySQL, that would be the sleep() function.
