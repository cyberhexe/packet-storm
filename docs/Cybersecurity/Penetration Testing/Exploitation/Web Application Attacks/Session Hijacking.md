## Session Hijacking

Depending on any session protection mechanisms that may be present in the web application, we may have the ability to steal cookies and session information.

This would allows us to impersonate our victim and access their resources from a different location while bypassing any authentication.

This is known as session hijacking attack and is a well known vector while attacking web applications.

The session token could be compromised in different ways; the most common are:

- Predictable session token;
- Session Sniffing;
- Client-side attacks (XSS, malicious JavaScript Codes, Trojans, etc);
- Man-in-the-middle attack
- Man-in-the-browser attack
