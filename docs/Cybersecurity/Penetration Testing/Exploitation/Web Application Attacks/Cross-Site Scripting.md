## Description


XSS vulnerabilities are caused due to unsanitized user input that is then displayed on a web page in HTML format.
It relies on the fact that user input is not properly validated and sanitized before being displayed to the end-user.
These vulnerabilities allow malicious attackers to inject client side scripts, such as JavaScript, into web pages viewed by other users.

Although XSS attacks don't directly compromise a machine, these attacks can still have significant impacts, such as cookie stealing and authentication bypass, redirecting the victimâ€™s browser to a malicious HTML page, and more.

XSS vulnerabilities often go hand-in-hand with client side attacks, as they often allow for the redirection of a victimâ€™s browser to a location of your choosing.
