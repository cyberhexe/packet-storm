## Type Juggling

While type juggling vulnerabilities can arguably be called exotic, they can sometimes result in exploitable vulnerabilities.

The vulnerability revolves around the use of loose comparisons of user-controlled values, which results in the execution of implicit data conversions.

Software developers with a background in different languages tend to use loose comparisons more often due to their lack of familiarity of string comparisons.
While strict comparisons compare both the data values and the types associated to them, a loose comparison only makes use of context to understand of what type the data is.
