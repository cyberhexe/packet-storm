## Function Return Mechanics

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack-based_memory_allocation

When code within a thread calls a function, it must know which address to return to once the function completes. The "return address" (along with function parameters and local variables) is stored on the stack.

This collection of data is associated with one function call and is stored in a section of the stack memory known as a `stack frame`.

When a function ends, the return address is taken from the stack and used to restore the execution flow to the calling function.
