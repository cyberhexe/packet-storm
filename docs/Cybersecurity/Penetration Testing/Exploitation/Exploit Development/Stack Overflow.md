## Stack Overflow

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffer_overflow

Stack memory can be affected by invalid user input.

There are 3 main ways to identify flaws in the applications:
- If the source code of the application is available then source code review is  probably the easiest way to identify bugs. 
- If the application is closed-source, then reverse-engineering techniques can be employed to understand the execution flow of the program and search for bugs in this flow.
- We could try to identify as many input points that application may have and simply try to send various malformed data to this input points and watch for the unexpected program behavior. This process is called fuzzing.
 
## General Information

Often times the certain functions of the code of a program will call additional functions, which intern will call even more functions. 
When this happens, the execution of each function remain suspended until the last function in the chain returns it's value.

All the information needed to resume the execution of this chain of functions once the last functions returns it's values is stored in the part of the memory called `the stack`.
The Stack also contains stored local variables used by the program as the program uses this variables to complete it's task.

The problems arise when the code of those programs does not manage it's memory correctly.
For example: by not sanitizing user's input allowing external interference with an execution of the program.
