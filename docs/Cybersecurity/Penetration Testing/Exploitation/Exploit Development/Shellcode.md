## Locating Space for Our Shellcode

Shellcode is a collection of assembly instructions that, when executed, perform the desired action of the attacker. 
This typically involves opening a reverse or bind shell, but may also include more complex actions.

A standard reverse shell payload requires approximately 350-400 bytes of space.
