## General Information

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellcode

A shellcode is a set of CPU instructions meant to be executed after a vulnerability is successfully exploited. 
The term `shellcode` originally referred to the portion of an exploit used to spawn a root shell. While reverse shells are common, it's important to understand that we can use shellcode in much more complex ways.

A standard reverse shell payload requires approximately 350-400 bytes of space.

Because shellcode is generally written in the assembly language first, and then translated into the corresponding hexadecimal opcodes, it can be used to directly manipulate CPU registers, and call system functions.

Writing universal and reliable shellcode, particularly for the Windows platform, can be challenging and requires some low-level knowledge of the operating system. For this reason, it is often shrouded in mystery.
