## Assembly Instructions

### NEG

The `NEG` instruction negates a value by finding 2's complement of its single operand.
This simply means multiply operand by -1.

When a positive value is negated the result is negative.
A negative value will become positive.

Zero remains zero.

For example,
```text
mov   al, -1   ; Load register
neg   al       ; AL now has 1
```
