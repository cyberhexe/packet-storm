## Memory Protection

- `Rebase` - Indicates that a memory address should be changed after each run. When there is no such protection, this DLL will always reliably load to the same address.
- `Data Execution Prevention (DEP)` - DEP is a set of hardware, and software, technologies that perform additional checks on memory, to help prevent malicious code from running on a system. Executable Space Protection marks memory regions as non-executable, such that an attempt to execute machine code in these regions will cause an exception. It makes use of hardware features such as the NX bit (no-execute bit), or in some cases software emulation of those features.
- `Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)` - ASLR randomizes the base addresses of loaded applications, and DLLs, every time the Operating System is booted.
