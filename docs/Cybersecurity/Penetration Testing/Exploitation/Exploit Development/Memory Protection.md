## Memory Protection

### DEP - Data Execution Prevention

`DEP` is a set of hardware and software technologies that perform additional memory checks to help prevent malicious code from running on a system. 
`DEP` helps prevent code execution from data pages by raising an exception when attempts are made to do so.

### ASLR - Address Space Layout Randomization

`ASLR` randomizes the base addresses of loaded applications and DLLs every time the operating system is booted. 
On older Windows operating systems, like Windows XP where `ASLR` is not implemented, all DLLs are loaded at the same memory address every time, which makes exploitation easier. 

When coupled with `DEP`, `ASLR` provides a very strong mitigation against exploitation.

### CFG - Control-Flow Integrity

This mechanism performs validation of indirect code branching such as a call instruction that uses a register as an operand rather than a memory address such as `CALL EAX`. 
The purpose of this mitigation is to prevent the overwrite of function pointers in exploits.
