## Using a Debugger

A debugger is a computer program inserted between the target application and the CPU, in principle, acting like a proxy.

Using a debugger allows us to view and interact with the memory and execution flow of applications.
The memory space of most operation systems, including Windows, is divided into two parts, kernel mode (ring 0) and user mode (ring 3).

## Debugging Symbols

Symbol files permit to reference internal functions, structures, and global variables using names instead of addresses.
