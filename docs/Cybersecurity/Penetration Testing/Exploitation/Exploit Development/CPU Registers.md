## CPU Registers

The CPU Registers help to store program variables and data as the program runs.
Each Register has various properties and it used for the certain things.
In other words, the EIR Register controls the execution flow of the program.

Several registers such as `EAX`, `EBX`, `ECX`, `EDX`, `ESI`, and `EDI` are often used as general purpose registers to store temporary data. There is much more to this discussion (as explained in various online resources), but the primary registers for our purposes are described below:

- `EAX (the accumulator)` - Arithmetical and logical instructions
- `EBX (base)` - Base pointer for memory addresses
- `ECX (the counter)` - Loop, shift, and rotation counter
- `EDX (data)` - I/O port addressing, multiplication, and division
- `ESI (the source index)` - Pointer addressing of data and source in string copy operations
- `EDI (the destination index)` - Pointer addressing of data and destination in string copy operations
- `ESP (the stack pointer)` - The Extended Stack Pointer Register most commonly points to the top of the running processes stack allowing to program to push or pop values from the stack
- `EIP (the instruction pointer)` - The Extended Instruction Pointer Register holds the current address location for the instruction being executed at any given time. The `EIP` Register controls the path of code execution of a program.

A pointer is a reference to an address (or location) in memory. When we say a register "stores a pointer" or "points" to an address, this essentially means that the register is storing that target address.

### ESP - The Stack Pointer

The stack is used for storage of data, pointers and arguments. Since the stack is dynamic and changes constantly during program execution, the stack pointer ESP keeps "track" of the most recently referenced location on the stack (top of the stack) by storing a pointer to it.
