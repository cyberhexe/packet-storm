## Calling Conventions

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calling_convention

Calling conventions describe how functions receive their parameters from the caller and how they return the result.

The x86 architecture allows for the use of multiple calling conventions. 
The difference in their implementation consists of several factors such as how the parameters and the return value are passed (placed in the CPU registers, pushed on the stack, or both), in which order they are passed, how the stack is prepared and cleaned up before and after the call, and what CPU registers the called function must preserve for the caller.

Generally speaking, the compiler determines which calling convention is used for all functions in a program, however, in some cases, it is possible for the programmer to specify a specific calling convention on a per-function basis.
