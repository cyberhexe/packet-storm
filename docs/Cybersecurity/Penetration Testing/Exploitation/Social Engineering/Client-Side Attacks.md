## General Information

Client side attacks are probably the most insidious form of remote attack.

A client side attack involves exploiting a weakness in client software, such as a browser (as opposed to server software, such as a POP3 server), in order to gain access to a machine.
The nastiness of client side attacks stems from the victim computer not having to be routable, or directly accessible, to the attacker.

Imagine a scenario where an employee inside a non-routable internal network receives an email with a link to a malicious website.
The employee clicks on the link, which leads him to an HTML page that contains exploit code for his unpatched Internet Explorer browser.
The HTML code triggers a buffer overflow vulnerability, and a reverse shell is sent from the internal corporate machine, which resides behind a firewall, to the external attacker on port 443.

As a network administrator, it is relatively easy to protect a single server. However, protecting and monitoring all the clients in the network is not a simple task.
Furthermore, monitoring and updating software versions (such as WinZip, Winamp, WinRAR, Acrobat Reader, browser plugins, etc) on all the clients in the network is an almost impossible job.

## Know Your Target

The issue with client side attacks, from an attacker's standpoint, is that the enumeration of the victim client software cannot be done easily.

Unlike a POP3, or FTP server, you can't independently probe ports to discover this information.

Therefore, the secret to success in client side attacks is once again information gathering.
We can gather information about an unreachable target, or client software, passively or actively.

## Passive Client Information Gathering

Passive Client Information Gathering may involve searching Google for the emails, employee names, and other publicly available information. 
In general, this is all kinds of intelligence without direct communication with the target.

## Active Client Information Gathering

This is any action that involves direct contact with the target organization or its users, such as placing a phone call and impersonating a company support technician of a frustrated client, in an attempt to extract useful information from the person on the other side of the line.
This could also involve sending an initial email to the target, with hope for a response, or a link click, that would lead the victim’s browser to a page that enumerates the user’s browser version, and installed extensions.
