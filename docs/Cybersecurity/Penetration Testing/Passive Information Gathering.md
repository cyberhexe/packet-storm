## General information

Passive information gathering is the process of collecting information about your target using publicly available sources. 

This could include services like:
- search engine results;
- whois information;
- background check services;
- public company information, 
- in other words, any act of gathering information about your target without communicating with them directly can be considered "passive".


As with anything in life, preparation leads to success. 
Specifically for us, this means that the more information we manage to gather about our target, prior to our attack, the more likely we are to succeed.

## Know your target

Information-gathering in a penetration test is the most important phase.
Knowing your target before attacking it is a proven recipe for success. Even mundane forum posts can provide you with useful information.

Once an engagement starts, it’s important to first spend some time browsing the web, looking for background information about the target organization.
- What do they do?
- How do they interact with the world? 
- Do they have a sales department? 
- Are they hiring? 

Browse the organization’s website, and look for general information such as:
1. Contact information 
2. Phone and fax numbers 
3. Emails
4. Company structure 
and so on.

Also, be sure to look for sites that link to the target site, or for company emails floating around the web.
Sometimes, it’s the smallest details that give you the most information:
- How well designed is the target website? 
- How clean is their HTML code?

This might give you a clue about their web development budget, which may reflect on their security budget.
