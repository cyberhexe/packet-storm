## Establishing HTTP tunnels

HTTP Tunneling is a technique whereby a payload protocol is encapsulated within the HTTP protocol, usually as the body of a HTTP GET or POST request. 

When behind an HTTP proxy server, a variation of HTTP tunneling is to use the CONNECT HTTP method, where a client uses the HTTP CONNECT method to ask the proxy server to forward a TCP connection to a specific destination. 
The proxy then proceeds to make the connection on behalf of the client. Once the connection with the server has been established, the proxy server continues to proxy the TCP stream to and from the client.

Testing a proxy with netcat:

```bash
root@kali:~# nc -vvn 192.168.1.130 8888
(UNKNOWN) [192.168.1.130] 8888 (?) open
CONNECT 10.11.1.203:80 HTTP/1.0
