Manipulation 
- Manipulation is the intent to win at all cost without considering the affect on the target, we view this as paving the way to manipulation. Indeed, targets of manipulation often feel shame, anger, and resentment. Consequently, manipulating people is not a productive technique in security training.

Incentives
- Incentives are at the core of understanding human behavior. Indeed, they are at the very core of understanding why people do what they do. For this reason, understanding incentives will help us learn how to motivate people to what we want them to do.
- For us to clearly understand this we need to have an understanding of what an incentive is.  An incentive is: “something that incites or has a tendency to incite to determination or action “

Purpose
- With the target and the objective in mind, identify which incentive will be the central motivator of the manipulation. You can read a good form of this concept  in the posting The 3 Motivations of People, Material, Social and Ideological. 

Financial Incentives
- Financial incentives are the most common incentives due to their predominance in the economy and various government programs. A decent description of this was posted on knowledgerush.com and can be read here. Many scams take the approach of manipulation of financial incentives by promising large financial gain with minimal effort or cost. See Advance fee fraud and Lottery.

Social Incentives
- Social Incentives relate to what would commonly be viewed as peer pressure. In other words, a person’s desire for their community to accept and respect them.
- However, these concepts are not new at all, as can be found documented in an US Air Force study from 1975 Management of Social Incentives in Air Force Technical Training written by the US Air Force. Companies often use social incentive programs instead of financial programs because they successfully drive employee behavior at a lower cost.  Because different incentives drive different people, it’s important to understand what social aspects matter to the target.
- The desire for peer acceptance is a commonality among humans. Social engineers will often use this “built-in” desire to make people feel a sense of obligation into performing some act or thinking a certain way, making it easier for the social engineer to achieve their goals. We call this Social Validation. We know this works by just looking at the life of teenagers. How many PSA’s, school meetings and commercials warn of the dangers of smoking, drug use and the like… yet the fact that all of our friends do it can make us ignore all that counsel and “give it a try”.

Ideological Incentives
- Ideological incentives have to do with how one looks at themselves, as opposed to how social incentives relate to how others see them. Other ways to think about ideological incentives would be moral or ethical incentives. A common method to obtaining gain from another through manipulation of Ideological incentives is the pervasive “Will Work For Food” sign held by distraught looking individuals in high traffic areas.
